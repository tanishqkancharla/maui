# Maui

TypeScript-first design system styled with `purse-styles`. Wrap the app in `MauiProvider`, then import tokens and components from `"maui"`.

```ts
import { style } from "purse-styles"
import {
	MauiProvider,
	background,
	border,
	colors,
	radius,
	shadow,
} from "maui"

function App() {
	return (
		<MauiProvider>
			{/* … */}
		</MauiProvider>
	)
}
```

The published package exposes:

- `"maui"` — compiled barrel (`dist/`) of provider, theme, tokens, and components
- `"maui/icons"` — tree-shakeable named icon modules (same names as `Icons.*`)
- `"maui/src"` — TypeScript source barrel
- `"maui/src/*"` — TypeScript source for deep imports
- `"maui/skills/maui"` — this skill file
- `"maui/skills/maui/*"` — reference files next to this skill

`MauiProvider` sets up theme (`data-theme` / `color-scheme`), `PurseProvider`, design-system globals, and the focus UI database used by Button/Dialog.

## How to learn Maui

Prefer this skill for composition knowledge — how to assemble tokens, components, patterns, and apps. Reach for package source (`"maui/src/patterns"`, `"maui/src/apps"`, or an install under `node_modules`) when you need a detail the skill does not cover.

Before designing or implementing new UI:

1. Read the constraints in this file.
2. Open the matching reference (same grouping as the [gallery nav](https://maui.tanishqkancharla.dev)) and reuse its structure, tokens, and interactions.

| Need | Read |
| --- | --- |
| Tokens, `purse-styles`, motion, layout, theme | [references/tokens.md](references/tokens.md) |
| A component | [Components](#components) |
| A pattern | [Patterns](#patterns) |
| An app | [Apps](#apps) |
| Live JSX playground | [jsx-editor.md](references/apps/jsx-editor.md) |

Patterns, demo apps, and the gallery `Panel` preview surface are **not** part of the `"maui"` package barrel. Prefer the recipes in those references and rebuild with barrel exports (`Button`, `Flex`, `text(...)`, …).

## Design constraints

- Hover backgrounds have no transitions. Hover fills (`backgroundColor.elementHover`, quiet-button washes, list/row highlights) snap instantly. Do not animate `background` / `background-color` on hover with `motion.standard(...)` or a CSS `transition`. Other motion (tooltips, transforms) is fine.
- Simple apps default to a `proseMaxWidth` column (`72ch`) centered in their container: `width: "100%"`, `maxWidth: proseMaxWidth`, `marginInline: "auto"`. `sizing.contentWidth` is the same measure. Use this for single-column tools, settings, forms, and reading layouts. Multi-pane or full-bleed apps (inbox, calendar, IDE) are the exception.
- Always design empty states. Every list, inbox, search result, or collection needs an intentional empty composition (copy and an optional action), never a blank panel.

## Theme FOUC

Put the exported `themeFoucScript` string in a classic inline `<script>` in `<head>` (before React boots) so `data-theme` is correct on first paint. The gallery `src/index.html` uses the same script.

Use `useTheme()` for preference / resolved theme. Token dark values use the `DARK_THEME` selector (`:root[data-theme="dark"]`). Prefer semantic tokens (`colors`, `background`, `avatar`, `focusRing()`) over bespoke CSS variables.

## Shadows

Use the three-level elevation scale:

- `shadow.subtle` — controls, cards, and ordinary raised surfaces
- `shadow.medium` — tooltips and larger floating panels
- `shadow.strong` — dropdowns, popovers, and dominant overlays

All three already include a 1px ring. Do not also apply `border()`, `borderColor.outline`, or another ring on the same element.

Buttons and form-control surfaces use `shadow.subtle` by default. For compound
controls, apply it once to the outer control boundary rather than to every
internal button or segment.

## Focus

`focusRing()` applies a theme-aware Radix blue shadow (`blueAlpha[8]` hard edge + `blueAlpha[5]` glow). Do not hand-roll a competing outline or box-shadow for keyboard focus.

## Layout utilities

`Flex`, `Padding`, and `Gap` take spacing scale steps (`1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 12 | 16`), not raw pixels. Example: `<Flex row gap={4}>` is 9px, not 4px. `Spacer` grows to fill leftover flex space. `Divider` is a horizontal rule.

## Icons

Import named icons so unused SVGs are tree-shaken. Do not import the `Icons` namespace in app code unless you want the full set.

```ts
import { Search, Plus } from "maui"
import { Text as TextIcon } from "maui/icons"

<Search size="sm" />
<TextIcon size="md" />
```

`size` uses the same t-shirt scale as `text(...)` (`2xs`–`xl`, default `sm`). Stroke and fill use `currentColor`. Icons that share a root export name (`Text`, `Badge`, `Switch`, `H1`, `H2`, `H3`, `Link`, `Menu`, `Code`, `Blockquote`, `Padding`, `SearchField`) are `TextIcon` / `BadgeIcon` / … from `"maui"`, or the original name from `"maui/icons"` / `Icons.Text`.

## Editor

Gallery top-level `/editor` (not under Apps). Live JSX playground: [jsx-editor.md](references/apps/jsx-editor.md).

## Components

Gallery order. Props and composition live in the linked file.

## Patterns

Not on the `"maui"` barrel. Prefer the recipes; rebuild with barrel exports in consuming apps. Hover fills snap; empty collections get copy.

| Page | Role | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inbox | Mail thread list with unread dot, hover actions, selection | [inbox.md](references/patterns/inbox.md) |
| Message list | Thread of raised message cards (avatar + Prose body) | [message-list.md](references/patterns/message-list.md) |
| Assistant message | Streaming markdown reply (Streamdown + Maui prose + CodeBlock) | [assistant-message.md](references/patterns/assistant-message.md) |
| Sidebar | 240px nav: sections, active item, optional icon and trailing badge | [sidebar.md](references/patterns/sidebar.md) |

## Apps

Not on the `"maui"` barrel. Prefer these layouts; rebuild with barrel exports.

| Page | Role | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Email client | Two-pane inbox + reading pane | [email-client.md](references/apps/email-client.md) |
| AI chat | Mock streaming chat (Editor + AssistantMessage + Thinking) | [ai-chat.md](references/apps/ai-chat.md) |
| Calendar | Three-pane schedule (mini month, week grid, event details) | [calendar.md](references/apps/calendar.md) |
